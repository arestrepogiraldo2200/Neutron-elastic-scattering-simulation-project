--------Fix-Target-Experiment
Mono-energetic neutron beam, a film
of heavy nuclei and a counter


--------Scattering cross section 
It gives an information about the probability,
that a neutron (or any other particle) is being deflected by a certain angle after the collision
with another particle (e.g. a nucleus) and therefore passing a certain area.It depends on the
energy of the neutrons and on the atoms that build up the film.



Dependence of scattering cross sections on those two
parameters.


Incoming free particles as a plane wave exp(ikz)
neglect the fact of polarization


f(θ)exp(ikr)/r


Schrödinger equation
The mass is represented by the reduced mass of the neutron-nucleus system


ψ(r) → exp(ikz) + f(θ)exp(ikr)r,    r → ∞.
Asymptotic form of the wave function is used, is that the observer (in this
case the counter) is far away compared to the size of the neutrons and nuclei and is therefore
in the asymptotic region.





More generally the Woods-Saxon potential is a spherically
symmetric potential and describes the forces on each nucleon inside the nucleus in the nuclear
shell model


Extending a potential or any other quantity by an imaginary part is very intuitive, as we
must only add an imaginary potential to the real one.
---The main motivation behind introducing an imaginary part into our potential is to consider
absorption effects that occur when incoming particles encounter the nucleus



------------------Spin-orbit term
It then makes a difference, whether the orbital angular
momentum vector is parallel or anti-parallel to the spin angular momentum vector, as the
scattered beams will be diffracted in a slightly different angle
