# Neutron elastic scattering simulation project

Plots of the simulation can be found in directory ProjectFiles along with its comparison with actual measurements from NNDC. The codes WoodSaxon.cpp, WoodSaxon.h, Test.cpp, the notebook ResultsAndPlots/Graficas.ipynb generate all the data and the plots can be found at /ProjectFiles.

Credits to my parters in this project Juan S. Ram√≠rez and Carlos A. Granada.
